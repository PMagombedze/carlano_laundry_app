## Description

Carlano is a web app written in Python(Flask) and HTML/CSS with SQLite as the database and Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM. After noticing that the students at my university do not enjoying doing their own laundry, I decided to build this web app so as to provide these services to them(of course not for free).
